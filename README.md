# MCP Puppeteer Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Claude Code with comprehensive browser automation capabilities through Puppeteer. This server allows Claude to interact with web pages, take screenshots, execute JavaScript, and perform various browser automation tasks.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Want browser automation in Claude Desktop & Claude Code? Run this one command:**

```bash
npx puppeteer-mcp-claude install
```

**That's it!** The installer will automatically:
- Detect Claude Desktop and Claude Code on your system
- Configure both applications with browser automation tools
- Verify everything works across all detected Claude apps

Then restart your Claude apps and ask: *"Take a screenshot of google.com"* to test it out!

### üñ•Ô∏è Cross-Platform Support
- **macOS**: Claude Desktop + Claude Code
- **Linux**: Claude Desktop + Claude Code  
- **Windows**: Claude Code only

## Features

- **Browser Management**: Launch and close Chrome/Chromium browsers
- **Page Operations**: Create, navigate, and manage multiple browser tabs
- **Element Interaction**: Click, type, and extract text from web elements
- **JavaScript Execution**: Run custom JavaScript code in the browser context
- **Screenshot Capture**: Take full-page or viewport screenshots

## Installation

### üöÄ Automatic Setup (Recommended)

**Get browser automation in all your Claude apps with just one command:**

```bash
npx puppeteer-mcp-claude install
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Downloads the latest version from npm
2. ‚úÖ **Detects Claude Desktop and Claude Code** on your system
3. ‚úÖ **Configures both applications** automatically 
4. ‚úÖ Creates config files if needed (cross-platform paths)
5. ‚úÖ Verifies everything is working correctly
6. ‚úÖ Shows you exactly what to do next

**Cross-platform detection:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` (Desktop) + `~/.claude/` (Code)
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/` (Desktop) + `~/.claude/` (Code)
- **Windows**: `~/.claude/` (Code only)

**After installation:**
- Restart any running Claude applications
- Ask Claude: *"List all available tools"*
- You'll see 11 new puppeteer tools for browser automation!

**No manual configuration needed!** The installer handles everything across all platforms.

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using Claude Code MCP Command

You can also configure this server using Claude Code's built-in MCP management:

```bash
claude mcp add puppeteer-mcp-claude
```

### Method 2: Manual Configuration

Create or edit `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer-mcp-claude": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["puppeteer-mcp-claude", "serve"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Post-Installation Steps

1. **Restart Claude Code** if it's currently running
2. **Test the integration**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   ```
3. **Verify in Claude Code** by asking: "List all available tools"

You should see the Puppeteer tools listed among the available tools.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Web Automation
```javascript
// Launch browser
await puppeteer_launch({ headless: false });

// Create a new page
await puppeteer_new_page({ pageId: "main" });

// Navigate to a website
await puppeteer_navigate({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  url: "https://example.com" 
});

// Take a screenshot
await puppeteer_screenshot({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  path: "screenshot.png" 
});
```

### Form Interaction
```javascript
// Type into a search field
await puppeteer_type({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  selector: "input[name='search']", 
  text: "Claude AI" 
});

// Click a button
await puppeteer_click({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  selector: "button[type='submit']" 
});

// Wait for results to load
await puppeteer_wait_for_selector({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  selector: ".search-results" 
});
```

### Data Extraction
```javascript
// Extract text from an element
await puppeteer_get_text({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  selector: "h1" 
});

// Execute custom JavaScript
await puppeteer_evaluate({ 
  pageId: "main", 
  script: "document.querySelectorAll('a').length" 
});
```

## Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run setup-mcp` | Automatically configure MCP server |
| `npm run remove-mcp` | Remove MCP server configuration |
| `npm run status-mcp` | Check current configuration status |
| `npm run test:integration` | Test the MCP server integration |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Claude Code doesn't see the tools**:
   - Ensure Claude Code is restarted after configuration
   - Check that the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct
   - Verify the MCP server is configured properly with `npm run status-mcp`

2. **"Browser not launched" errors**:
   - Always call `puppeteer_launch` before using other tools
   - Make sure the browser launch was successful

3. **Element not found errors**:
   - Use `puppeteer_wait_for_selector` before interacting with elements
   - Verify selectors are correct using browser developer tools

4. **Permission errors**:
   - Make sure the project directory has proper permissions
   - Check that `ts-node` is installed and accessible

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can run the server in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will show detailed logs of all MCP operations.

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:
```bash
npm test
```

For integration testing with Claude Code:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## Security Considerations

- The server runs with the same permissions as the user
- Browser instances are automatically cleaned up on exit
- All JavaScript execution happens in the browser context, not the Node.js process
- Network requests are subject to the same security policies as a regular Chrome browser

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Chrome/Chromium browser (automatically downloaded by Puppeteer)
- Claude Code with MCP support
- TypeScript support (`ts-node`)

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your configuration with `npm run status-mcp`
3. Run the integration tests with `npm run test:integration`
4. Check Claude Code logs for MCP-related errors
